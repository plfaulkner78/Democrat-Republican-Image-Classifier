# Democrat-Republican Image Classifier

Convolutional neural networks are powerful machine learning models that can achieve great performance classifying images. Unfortunately, when learning about CNNs most of the datasets I worked with were pretty boring, like Fashion-MNIST or CIFAR-10. So I started to ask myself what would be a fascinating image classification task for me personally.

Since we were in the midst of an election season, I started to wonder whether or not it would be possible to determine someoneâ€™s political leanings based on his or her appearance alone. To answer this question, I built an image classifier trained on images of politicians with the hope that the model would be able to determine whether someone is a Democrat or a Republican based on his or her face alone. To train this model, I used the images of every member of Congress, the 435 members of the House and the 100 senators (plus some non-voting House members).
